# Data Description
An overview of the research project and various types of data to be collected
# Roles and responsibilities
Outlines the collaborators and their responsibilities towards the completion of the project.

The PI will be responsible for implementing the DMP, but the Graduate Student will be responsible for distributing it to our collaborators and ensuring policies are followed properly. The research conducted in this study is considered sensitive material, because some of it is preserved tissues of farmed molluscan shellfish and contains disease information that may be a risk for commercial farmers. Research data collected in our study will be in the form of histological blocks, H&E-stained tissues obtained from the histological blocks, photos, PCR data and prevalence calculations, and metadata accessed from Coastal Data Information Program (CDIP). CDIP is an open-access database and the information obtained from this site must be cited but can be manipulated or shared freely. The histological blocks, slides, and PCR data are all owned and managed by the owner of AquaTechnics, Inc. Research materials and relevant data stored according to their policies, which involve storing preserved material that is categorized by case number and digital data are stored on a secure server. Backup of the digital files will be stored on a dedicated flash drive once a month. The PCR prevalence calculations and CDIP downloaded metadata are managed by the Hase Lab and stored on cloud drive services only accessible by current lab personnel. These cloud services remain in regular use by authorized lab personnel and access to this service is terminated upon leaving the lab. Data analysis will be conducted by the Graduate Student to ascertain relevant information about Denman Island Disease in Humboldt Bay, California. Quality control of the data will be shared between all project collaborators.
In the event a researcher or collaborator leaves the project, the data collected for this project stays with the appropriate party as outlined above and may not be transferred to another institution or research entity unless agreed upon by AquaTechnics, Inc. owner and the Hase Lab PI. Under such conditions, there must be clear parameters outlined on how the data may be used, shared, or manipulated.
